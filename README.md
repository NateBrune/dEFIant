# **Defiant**
##### The only ring0 game engine on the market
***

###### changelog:
* Version: 0.01 - Initial Testing

---
### What?
---
Defiant is a game engine. It was inspired by [HERITAGE](https://notabug.org/SylvieLorxu/HERITAGE). 

The main idea is that Defiant is a game engine that will parse .story files and turn them into a retro text adventure game. In the game you will be able to do whatever the game designer lets you do including things like
* chosing what to do next
* Setting a name for your character

And thats pretty much it ;p

The game designer designes a story to be told and you select what to do when prompted. Like a choose your own adventure book.

---
### Why?
---
> You: Why would you do this? This is really dumb and isnt practical.
 
Throughout history ring-3 has plagued game engines. "We want to implement our own file-system and write our own drivers for the mouse" screamed indie-game designers everywhere. Well, now you can! Can-t, sheesh lemme finish my sentance. But with this code being open source who knows where the ring-0 train goes? 

On a more serious note, I am not sure. It is an experiment as far as I am concerned. This initially was going to be its own kernel instead of a UEFI application. I didnt feel like programming all the drivers I would need to really have my vision come to life to here it is, a half-working UEFI game engine. This could also prove to be a good resource for others like me.

### About the author.

Hi, I am Nate, nice to meet you. At the time of this writing I am 16 and a junior in highschool. I have made a point out of doing whatever I feel like doing as far as computer science goes. I feel like its a great way to teach yourself. Hand-on experiance. I really wanted to get an idea of UEFI programming so with just my Hello World program in hand, I set out to make this monster.
